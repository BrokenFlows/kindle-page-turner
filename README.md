# Kindle Page Turner

**Documentation still ongoing, but all required files are in the repo**

The code in this repository, along with the physical components outlined in the [Bill of Materials](####Bill-of-Materials)

The goal of this project is to turn the pages of a kindle using external buttons, for when the kindle is in a stand. Navigating the user interface of the kindle is outside the capabilities of this project.

This will be done with a kindle, a 3D-printed case, a Raspberry Pi Pico, a pair of servo motors, and some external buttons.

#### Tools
- Soldering Iron
- Solder Wire
- 3D Printer/ 3D Printing Service/ or some arts and crafts to mimic [the case and parts](./stls/) above
- Scissors/ wire cutter
- **Optional:** wire stripper

#### 3D Printing
I recommend 3D printing the stl files at the following settings:
### Filament
PLA or similar
### Nozzle Diameter
0.4 mm or smaller
### Layer Height
0.2 mm or less
### Infill
20% or more
### Supports
Off

### Software
I recommend following [this article](https://www.twilio.com/blog/programming-raspberry-pi-pico-microcontroller-micropython) on how to install micropython and transfer files onto the Raspberry Pi Pico.
If you copy [main.py](./main.py) onto the Raspberry Pi Pico, after installing micropython and setting up the hardware, it should allow buttons to turn the pages of the kindle.
