# Kindle Page Turner
**IMPORTANT:** This project is a work in progress, and is not yet complete.

The goal of this project is to turn the pages of a kindle using external buttons, for when the kindle is in a stand.

This will be done with a kindle, a 3D-printed case, a Raspberry Pi Pico, a pair of servo motors, and some external buttons.
